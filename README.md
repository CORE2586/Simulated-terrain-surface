# Simulated-terrain-surface
   • Construct a simulated terrain surface based on a mathematical surface that can be compared with the actual terrain analysis results. 
   • Obtain simulated point clouds on the simulated terrain surface. 
   • Run this program using MATLAB software. 
   • The files"T1_rand1.txt"and"T2_tand1.txt"contain the point cloud data used for the experiment.
